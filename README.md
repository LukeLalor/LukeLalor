# Hi there 👋 I'm Luke

I'm a software engineer with 10+ years of experience passionate about bridging the gap between cutting-edge AI and enterprise infrastructure. Currently, I'm focused on building robust, scalable LLM applications and distributed systems.

## 🔭 Current Work

I'm a technical founder of [Eidolon AI](https://eidolonai.com/), an agent framework that enables developers to rapidly build and deploy production-grade AI applications. Some highlights:

- 🤖 Pioneered auto-discoverable multi-agent architecture
- 🚀 Secret Free, deterministic testing framework built in
- 📈 Growing community with 200+ unique users

## 🛠️ Featured Projects

### [Droid Please](https://github.com/LukeLalor/droid-please)
An LLM-powered coding assistant designed to integrate directly with your version control system.
- Reduces compute by deduplicating work done per-developer (embeddings, prject exploration, etc)
- Allows teams to optimize systems per-project rather than individual developers re-honing local agents / prompts
- Obvious integration point for PR assistant agents to make small (and eventually large) changes.

### [Typed AI](https://github.com/eidolon-ai/typed-ai)
A typed Python OpenAI client featuring:
- Pydantic-based schema definitions for tool calls and structured output
- Full streaming support
- IDE type hints

## 💼 Technical Experience

- **Distributed Systems**: Built and scaled enterprise ML platforms at DataRobot and Paxata
- **Infrastructure**: Extensive experience with Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
- **Languages**: Python, Scala, Java, TypeScript
- **Big Data**: Apache Spark, MongoDB, Vector DBs
- **MLOps**: CI/CD pipelines, testing frameworks, deployment automation

*Always interested in collaborating on innovative projects in AI, distributed systems, and developer tools. [Feel free to reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukehlalor/)!*
